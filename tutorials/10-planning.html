                    <h2>What is a planning document?</h2>
                    <p>A planning document is a great way to collect information about a design project and share your inspiration, as well as propose certain design directions and explain why. For our program, this is an 8.5" by 11" landscape pdf you will share with your professors before you create visuals and after you create visuals and develop your designs. At the end of it, you'll have created a process book</p>
                    <h3>Design <em>is</em> Planning</h3>
                    <p>The journey is <em>money</em>. In your planning document you can help your client (instructor) understand your thought processes. The more you take this assignment seriously, the better your will get overtime.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Title Page</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Include the project name, your name, instructor name, course name, semester & year</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Creative/Client Brief</h3>
                        <p>Complete a brief to detail your client, their history, who is their target audience, what are their needs & goals, and identifying design needs (what do you have and what do you need to create or find). DO NOT just copy what's in your project description. This is more about the client and the audience you are working with than just the overview I've given.</p>

                                <p>If you are doing a redesign, it would be a good idea to share what pages need a redesign and explain why. You can focus on the pages that relate to the assignment or go beyond that.</p>
                            </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Personas</h3>
                        <p>Create 2 personas to represent the target audience. This should be a fully fleshed out persona using as much real world aspects as possible</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                            <li>
                                <p>Preferred Channels (to receive ads)</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                        <p>Include at least 15-20 pieces of research and inspiration. Look at a variety of websites to be inspired for your design. Don't just limit yourself to sites in the same industry; find sites that you feel could really speak to the target audience for this client as well as thinking outside the box. Think of more than just websites, though. Find things that inspire you; it could be anything from the design of icons (iconography) to the style of photography to shapes and patterns in nature that inspire your design. Don't limit yourself. This is one of the most important aspects of the design process. Include screenshots and write up a brief description of what you like about each piece of inspiration.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Sitemap</h3>
                        <p>Create a sitemap that identifies all pages needed within the site. Make sure the sitemap is easy to review. Feel free to make changes to the current sitemap if you feel it will help usability and flow.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Type Study</h3>
                        <p>Research fonts that you think would work well on the site. Think about how you're designing towards an experience and find colors and types that will help you in that endeavor. Give me 3 samples each of fonts for headers, subheads and body copy.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Color Study</h3>
                        <p>Color is just as important as type when it comes to design. Make sure you are thinking your color choices through carefully. Give me 3 potential color palettes as well.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Logo Study</h3>
                        <p>Provide sketches and vectored choices. At least 3 options.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Final choices for type, color, and logo</h3>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                        <p>Create 2 sets of wireframes for the home page and another page of your choice on a desktop. You will then create a second set of 2 detailing the wireframes of the previous pages in mobile view. (You will need to have 8 completed wireframes.</p>
                        <p>Wireframes should be easy to review, read and be clear enough that a client would understand them, even if you're not around. Simple shapes with no heading or acknowledgement what content is going where is not wireframing. Refer back to your Information Architecture course if you need to review good wireframing techniques.</p>

                <h2>Process Book</h2>
                <p>You are required to include a final process book to be turned in with your project files at the end. While design did not matter during the planning phase, the layout and design of the book matters for this portion. Name your process book <code>LastNameFirstInitial_PXProcess.pdf</code> (X is the current project number)</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The original planning document. Again, design matters in this portion of the project.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Your original comps. Discuss your design choices briefly. You don't have to write a novel, but you want people to be able to understand why you made the decisions you did.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Any revised comps. Again, briefly describe the changes you made and why.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Screenshots of final project. You should show the final project in a variety of browsers. Show that they work. Show the browser as well. Consider using mock ups for better presentation</p>
