                    <h2>What is FTP?</h2>
                    <p>As web designers you will need to know how to get your work uploaded to a web server. The process to transfer files to a web server is often referred to as FTP – which is an acronym that stands for "file transfer protocol". Essentially all it means is that you are uploading files to a web server. </p>
                    <h3>FTP Programs</h3>
                    <p>In our graphics labs computers should have a program named <a href="https://fetchsoftworks.com/">Fetch</a> installed on them. It is one of the easiest FTP programs to use on a macintosh computer. Students may <a href="https://fetchsoftworks.com/fetch/free">apply for a free license</a> for educational use.</p>
                    <p>Although we typically teach FTP by using Fetch, please know that there are many free programs that enable you to FTP from your own computer. It is wise this week to find a FTP program that will enable you to transfer your files this semester. Here are a few popular programs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.smartftp.com/">Smartftp</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireftp/">Fireftp</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Setting up your files for FTP</h2>
                    <p>Your folder set up should be as follows</p>

                <h2>Troubleshooting FTP</h2>
                <p>You all are likely new to FTP'ing and unless you have done FTP before it may seem daunting. We have a few suggestions for you to help you learn to troubleshoot if you run into troubles this semester. </p>
                <h3>Watch for typos</h3>
                <p>If you are having login troubles always first check to make sure you haven't made a typo. It's easy to do so and is a common error. Additionally be sure you are typing in all lowercase, with no spaces, and no special characters. Any typos could lead to errors when you attempt to login. </p>
                <h3>Always have an <code>index.html</code> file</h3>
                <p>The web server will search for a file named <code>index.html</code> so always ensure your html begins with an index page. It will be the first page that loads.</p>
                <h3>Check for file size</h3>
                <p>Graphics files can get big, especially if you ignore optimization of images. If you exceed your quota (50mb) you will get an error. If you go over your file quota be sure you haven't ftp'd any large files or unnecessary files. You will want to remove files that are too large or taking up space if you get into quota trouble. Please only remove work that has been graded to make room for new files. </p>
                <h3>FTP limitations</h3>
                <p>Our server is a little picky with how many of you can ftp at the same time. This is typically only a problem on demo day, however, if you find several students are trying to FTP at the same time we have found sometimes the host will temporarily block our ip address if too many people login at the same time. If this happens just log out and give it 5-10 minutes and typically you will be able to login again.</p>
                <h3>Do not try to login incorrectly more than 10 times</h3>
                <p>We know you all will try to login many times and if you have troubles try your best to work through them but please stop trying as you get close to 10 incorrect attempts. By this point the server may temporarily block your ip address if you try to login incorrectly too many times. Instead contact your instructor to request support with your ftp. </p>
