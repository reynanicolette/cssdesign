                <h2>Why it’s so important</h2>
                <p>There’s an insane amount of mobile users in the world today. Usability describes how efficient a website is. Is it effective? Are users completing the goals set for them? Can users figure out what to do with instructions given? Are you leaving a positive impression for users to want to come back?</p>

                <h2>Standard Sizes</h2>
                <p>TTechnically, there are no written rules just like everything else we’ve learned up to this point, but there are some best practices to get you started.</p>
                <p><strong>Small screen:</strong> under 600px</p>
                <p><strong>Medium screen:</strong> 600px - 900px</p>
                <p><strong>Large screen:</strong> 900 - 1440px</p>
                <p><strong>Extra Large:</strong> over 1440px</p>
                <p>The content on these different screens will be the same but scaled down to fit what the user is looking at. As you downsize it’s important to ensure the content being shown is the MOST important.</p>

                <h3>Hungryroot</h3>
                <p>Hungryroot is a meal plan dedicated to sharing healthy food with its customers. The home page is dedicated to sharing its benefits. Social media is saturated with many meal plans, so they have to bring great design efforts to make browsing a memorable experience.</p>

                <h2>Things to think about</h2>
                <ol class="margin-btm2">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Create a positive user experience</strong>
                        <p>Make sure you show the essential content the user is looking for and that they can accomplish the action your client wants them to do.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Design around your content</strong>
                        <p>Do not design with a specific screen size in mind. Adapt your design to smaller screen sizes and decide how the content will be organized.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Engagement is important</strong>
                        <p>Center your design around the goal of the website. Hierarchy might change while you’re designing for the smaller devices. It should be a faster experience.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Adaptable Navigation</strong>
                        <p>Navigation is such an important task for a lot of websites. If your users can jump from page to page without wondering where the navigation is, you have a really good one! But how willl you show it? Will it be a list? Will there be a bottom navigation menu? Will there be a menu button? This all depends on how important your navigation process is.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Interactions add to the experience</strong>
                        <p>The average human thumb can successfully tap something that’s around 45-60px. The best thing to do is consider this on your largest design, so that you’re not scaling very element on your page. </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Once your design is ready, you can move onto the next step: development! There, we will learn how to bring our responsive designs to life.</p>
